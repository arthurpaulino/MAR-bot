# MAR-bot

My bot for the [Much Assembly Required](https://muchassemblyrequired.com) game.

Build with `$ sh build.sh`, copy the code from the (created) `MuchAssemblyRequired.s` file and then paste it into the game editor.

Press `ENTER` to go to *manual mode*. In *manual mode*, press `ESC` to go to *auto mode*.

## Manual mode

* `2` goes north
* `q` goes south
* `1` goes west
* `w` goes east
* `e` collects biomass
* `d` drills
* `c` clears inventory

## Auto mode

```
find closest biomass
if could find it
    go for it //TODO
else
    migrate to a new world //TODO
```
